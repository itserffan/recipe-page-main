# Frontend Mentor - Recipe Page Solution

This is my solution for the [Recipe Page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm). This project focuses on creating a responsive recipe page using HTML and CSS, which adapts to various screen sizes and devices. It’s a great opportunity to refine layout techniques and responsive design.

## Overview

### The Challenge

This project was designed to:
- Create a recipe page using semantic HTML for clarity and accessibility.
- Design a visually appealing, clean layout that includes images, headings, and tables.
- Implement responsive styles to ensure usability on different screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.

## My Process

### Built With

- **Semantic HTML5** for a clear and accessible structure
- **CSS custom properties** for reusable styling
- **Flexbox** for flexible, one-dimensional layouts
- **CSS Grid** for complex, two-dimensional layouts
- **Mobile-first workflow** to ensure design responsiveness from the smallest screens up

### What I Learned

This project helped reinforce responsive design principles and CSS layout techniques, particularly using Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout flexibility across device sizes.

A key takeaway was using media queries effectively to adjust font sizes, paddings, and layout dimensions at different screen breakpoints. Here’s an example of the media queries applied:

```css
/* Small devices (phones) */
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  article {
    width: 90%;
    padding: 2.4rem;
  }
  h1 {
    font-size: 3.2rem;
  }
}

/* Medium devices (tablets) */
@media (min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1024px) {
  article {
    width: 70%;
    padding: 3.2rem;
  }
  h1 {
    font-size: 3.6rem;
  }
}
```

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to focus on:
- Enhancing accessibility by refining ARIA labels and semantic HTML structure.
- Experimenting with CSS animations to add subtle interactive elements to the UI.
- Exploring JavaScript for added functionality, such as ingredient filters or interactive cooking steps.
